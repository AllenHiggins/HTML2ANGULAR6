        Internt of Things assignment during distributed and concurrent device development module. The idea for this project
        was to create the illution of a 3D holographic display with upcycled hardware and materials while introducing a

          <a href="https://www.twitter.com/CipherAG">The Enigma Box </a>inspired by Alan Turing and the Enigma Machine of WWII. Using C# and Visual Studio I created an
          interface that encrypts and deciphers userâ€™s plain text messages.  These messages can have multiple levels of
          encryption, adding to its complexity in terms of simple machine permutations with intent to break the cipher.
          Just for fun, I posted cipher messages on Twitter... why not try and break the code.
